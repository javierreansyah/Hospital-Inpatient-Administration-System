This project is the final project for my Fundamental Programming Course at college. 
This java program aim is to help helathcare worker take care patient more efficiently in hospital by keeping data of their patient inside this program. Healthcare worker can easily find patient data like name, room number, and even medication. 
Healthcare worker can also know statistics of the overall patient in the inpatient departement example like how many patient are there, and which room is currently used.
