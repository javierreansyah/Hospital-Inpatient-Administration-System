# Hospital Inpatient Administration System

This project serves as the final assignment for my Fundamental Programming Course at college. The aim of this Java program is to assist healthcare workers in efficiently managing patient care within the hospital by maintaining comprehensive patient records. Healthcare workers can easily access patient information such as names, room numbers, and prescribed medications. Additionally, they can gather statistics related to the overall patient population in the inpatient department, such as the total number of patients and the current room occupancy status.
